## General info
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, and  Handlebars. Use MySQL to query, the server to route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## User Story
AS A developer learning Node Express Handlebars, 
I WANT to be able to demonstrate new knowledge using handlebars and deploying an app with a database to Heroku
SO THAT I can take the next step in showcasing my skills

## Instructions  
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
